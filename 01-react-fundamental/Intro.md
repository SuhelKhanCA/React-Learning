# React Fundamentals

- **Why React**: large community, most popular, Declarative, Mobile & Web app, good performance

## Key Concepts

### 1. Components

- **Definition**: Building blocks of a React application.
- **Types**: Functional and Class components. Functional components are used
- **Props**: Used to pass data to components.

### 2. JSX

- **Definition**: JavaScript XML, a syntax extension for JavaScript.
- **Usage**: Allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript.

### 3. State

- **Definition**: An object that determines how a component renders and behaves.
- **Usage**: Managed within the component, can change over time.

### 4. Lifecycle Methods

- **Definition**: Methods that get called at different stages of a component's life.
- **Examples**: `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`.

### 5. Hooks

- **Definition**: Functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.
- **Examples**: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`.

### 6. Virtual DOM

- **Definition**: A lightweight copy of the actual DOM.
- **Usage**: Improves performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulation.

### 7. Event Handling

- **Definition**: Handling user inputs and actions.
- **Usage**: Using camelCase syntax and passing functions as event handlers.

### 8. Conditional Rendering

- **Definition**: Rendering components or elements based on certain conditions.
- **Usage**: Using JavaScript conditional operators like `if`, `&&`, `? :`.

### 9. Lists and Keys

- **Definition**: Rendering lists of data and using keys to identify elements.
- **Usage**: Using `map()` to create lists and providing unique keys.

### 10. Context API

- **Definition**: A way to pass data through the component tree without passing props down manually.
- **Usage**: Creating a context, providing a context value, and consuming the context.

## Best Practices

- **Component Reusability**: Write components that can be reused across the application.
- **State Management**: Keep state as close to where it's needed as possible.
- **Code Organization**: Organize code into small, manageable files and folders.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use techniques like memoization and lazy loading.
